# Unoffice Hours
A webring for people offering Unoffice Hours.

## How to submit your site

**Add an Unoffice Hours page and the webring links to your site first**, then fork this repo, add your name and Unoffice Hours URL to the [sites.js](https://github.com/websmyth/unoffice-hours-webring/blob/main/sites.js) file, and send me a pull request. 

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with GitHub, [send me an email](mailto:dave@websmyth.co.uk) and I‚Äôll get you set up.

### What sorts of sites can join?

Unoffice Hours are a way to enable conversations and meeting people. Most of the sites in the webring are personal blogs ‚Äì this webring isn‚Äôt for businesses, unless the business is just you.

Unoffice Hours links aren‚Äôt actively checked, but links will be removed if I stumble across pages that no longer exist or have been repurposed to do something spammy or outside the spirit of the webring.

## How to add the webring to your site

You should display the links on your site somewhere: perhaps on your Unoffice Hours page. You can style the links however you want.

**All you need to do is add the following links to your site somewhere:**

| Link Description | URL |
|---|---|
| Previous site | `https://unofficehours.com/prev.html` |
| Next site | `https://unofficehours.com/next.html` |
| Random site | `https://unofficehours.com/random.html` |
| List all sites | `https://unofficehours.com` |
| Join the ring | `https://unofficehours.com/join.html` |

The link will work out your position in the list and redirect visitors to the next site in the webring.

## Links API

You can retrieve a list of the webring links (next/previous/random/list/join) as either an HTML unstyled-list partial or a JSON file from:

* [HTML](https://unofficehours.com/links.html)
* [JSON](https://unofficehours.com/links.json)

## Privacy

We don't collect or store any information beyond the list of sites themselves. This is for fun, not for profit.

## Credits

Matt Webb created [Unoffice Hours](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours) as a twist on office hours in September 2020.

This webring was launched in September 2021 to make it easier to find people offering Unoffice Hours.
